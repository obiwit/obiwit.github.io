<p class="description" data-aos="fade-down">I think the greatest thing about being alive is the interactions we get to have with the world and everyone in it. Technology never played such a large role in this as it does today. I love being able to contribute to projects and through my work aim to slightly nudge the world in good directions, and help us all lead a bit better lives.</p>

<p class="description" data-aos="fade-down">Data science is the perfect tool for this, both from the analysis perspective - to gain valuable insight into our lives, habits and a plethora of other important things - to its application counterpart - pushing the models and technology of today to create the future of tomorrow. My main interest lies in NLP (and other language-related fields and tasks), alongside interpretability, fairness, and reinforcement learning.</p>
    
<p class="description" data-aos="fade-down">I'm endlessly curious about people and the world in general, and both a fast and dedicated learner and problem solver, who will push through when working on something I believe in. Like Hans Rosling highlighted in Factfulness, the biggest progress is made in a steady and incremental manner. So even though I reach high, I'm pragmatic about it - and at the end of the day, even if I don't reach the stars, I'll at least have taken my feet of the ground and contributed to something worthwhile. Hopefully also making mom proud in the process.</p>
