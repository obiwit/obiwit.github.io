<!-- <p>Data science is the perfect tool for this, both from the analysis perspective - to gain valuable insight into our lives, habits and a plethora of other important things - to its application counterpart - pushing the models and technology of today to create the future of tomorrow. My main interest lies in NLP (and other language-related fields and tasks), alongside interpretability, fairness, and reinforcement learning.</p> -->

<p>I'm endlessly curious about people and the world in general, and both a fast and dedicated learner and problem solver, who will push through when working on something I believe in. Like Hans Rosling highlighted in Factfulness, the biggest progress is often made in a steady and incremental manner. Still, sometimes we must also take a step back and look at the bigger pictures - at the systems and beliefs that got us here in the first place. Even though I reach high, I'm pragmatic about it - and at the end of the day, even if I don't reach the stars, I'll at least have taken my feet of the ground and contributed to something worthwhile. Hopefully also making mom proud in the process.</p>

<p>Outside of work, I love to sing and do hikes in nature! And if you ever want to discuss the meaning of life, I'm always down for it :)</p>
