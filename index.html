<p>I am a PhD student at EPFL's <a href="https://nlp.epfl.ch/">NLP lab</a>, advised by <a href="https://atcbosselut.github.io">Antoine Bosselut</a>. I am interested in NLP in general! My current research focuses on finding better ways to align language models to human values, particularly looking at natural language feedback.

<p>I think the greatest thing about being alive is the interactions we get to have with the world and everyone in it. Technology never played such a large role in this as it does today. I love being able to contribute to projects and through my work aim to slightly nudge the world in good directions, and help us all lead a bit better lives.</p>
